# stochiometry_balancer
C++ chemical equation balancer

I wrote this code when I was in my first year of cegep, in 2013. It reads chemical equations and balances them.

To compile, all you need to do is run Make. You need g++ and might need boost. Tested only on linux but should work pretty much everywhere.

invertMatrix.hpp was found somewhere on the Internet.

Makefile and Makefile.bak were also found somewhere on the Internet and use makedepend to find all dependencies, but you don't really need that.

The rest of the code is mine.
